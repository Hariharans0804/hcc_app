This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

üõ† What taskkill Does
taskkill is a Windows command used to terminate (kill) a process running on your system ‚Äî like if it's stuck or you need to stop it manually.

We use it when something (like Metro bundler) is already using a port and we want to free that port.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Example to Kill Port 8081
üìç Step 1: Find the Process Using Port 8081
In Command Prompt (CMD), type:

netstat -ano | findstr :8081

Example output:

TCP    127.0.0.1:8081     0.0.0.0:0     LISTENING     12345
The last number (12345) is the PID (Process ID).

üìç Step 2: Kill the Process with That PID
Now run:

taskkill /PID 12345 /F
Replace 12345 with the number you got from above.

The /F flag means ‚Äúforcefully‚Äù kill it.

‚úÖ After that, port 8081 will be freed, and you can restart Metro:

npx react-native start
